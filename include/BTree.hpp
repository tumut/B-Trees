//! B-tree class
/*!
 * BTree can be used to store T-type values in binary files for fast retrieval
 * later. T must be a POD (Plain Old Data type) and _less-than_ comparable.
 *
 * Use the method BTree::create before inserting values and, once you've
 * finished inserting, call BTree::finishInsertions to update the file header.
 *
 * Use BTree::load before reading values.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code
 * BTree<int, 2> tree;
 *
 * // Insert data
 * tree.create("filename.bin");
 * tree.insert(1);
 * tree.finishInsertions();
 *
 * // Read data
 * tree.load("filename.bin");
 * int *x = tree.seek(1);
 * if (x) f(*x); // If found, do something to x
 * \endcode
 *
 * @tparam T Type of the data to be stored
 *
 * @tparam M Tree order. Each node will store up to 2M values and have up to
 * 2M + 1 children. A node can't be bigger than `BLOCK_SIZE` bytes.
 *
 * @tparam BlockSize Block size to use, in bytes
