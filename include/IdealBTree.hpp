//! Auxiliary function to calculate the max order of a BTree to store T-type values
/*!
 * The calculation is done based on BlockSize, the result being the max order
 * you can have for your tree without having your node exceed BlockSize in
 * bytes.
 *
 * We arrived at it through the following initial formula:
 *
 * `BlockSize = sizeof(long) + sizeof(bool) + sizeof(std::size_t) + (2 * M + 1) * sizeof(T) + (2 * M + 2) * sizeof(long)`
 *
 * This formula takes into account the size of members of a BTree::BNode.
 *
 * @tparam T Type that will be stored in BTree
 * @tparam BlockSize Size in bytes
 *
 * @return Calculation result
