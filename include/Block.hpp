 * Wraps a T-type value within a block-sized memory space. T must be a POD
 * (Plain Old Data type).

 * The condition `sizeof(T) <= BLOCK_SIZE` must be satisfied. Otherwise, the
 * stored value will be bigger than the block size and reading and writing will
 * be compromised.

 * This union is used to guarantee that written data in the files will always
 * individually occupy exactly one block in size. The remaining unused bytes
 * will have undefined values in the file.
 *
 * After using Block instances to write a file, use Block again when reading
 * the file.
